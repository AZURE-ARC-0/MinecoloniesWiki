# Sleep System

No matter how busy your thriving colony is, your colonists need to sleep. At the end of each day until sunrise the next day, they will go to their homes and sleep in their beds.

## Assigning Beds

[Houses](../../source/buildings/house) and [Taverns](../../source/buildings/tavern) provide most of your colonists with bedspaces to sleep in. If set in the [Townhall](../../source/buildings/townhall), you can manually assign colonists to beds in Houses or the Tavern.

## Number of Beds

Each colony can have only one Tavern by default. The Tavern will provide 4 beds. Upgrading does not increase the number of beds; however, it does affect skill caps and number and quality of visitors.

Each colony can have as many Houses as you'd like. Each House will provide one bed per level; i.e., a level 4 House will provide 4 beds, and a level 1 House will provide 1 bed. The House level also restricts colonist skill caps.

[Guard Towers](../../source/buildings/guardtower) provide 1 bed for a [Guard](../../source/workers/guard), while [Barracks](../../source/buildings/barracks) provide housing for many Guards. See those pages for more details.
